FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n","  image=torch.load(self.all_files[idx])\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Misclassified sample 1:\n","  Predicted: 0, True: 1\n","Misclassified sample 2:\n","  Predicted: 0, True: 1\n","Misclassified sample 3:\n","  Predicted: 1, True: 0\n","Misclassified sample 4:\n","  Predicted: 1, True: 0\n"]}],"source":["misclassified_samples = []  # To store misclassified samples\n","correct = 0\n","model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode\n","with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation during validation\n","    for x_test, y_test in validation_loader:\n","        # Move test data to the MPS device (or CPU)\n","        x_test, y_test = x_test.to(device), y_test.to(device)\n","\n","        # Make a prediction (forward pass)\n","        pred = model(x_test)\n","        # Find the class with the highest predicted score (logit)\n","        _, yhat = torch.max(pred, 1)\n","\n","        # Count correct predictions\n","        correct += (yhat == y_test).sum().item()\n","\n","        # Check for misclassified samples\n","        for i in range(len(y_test)):\n","            if yhat[i] != y_test[i]:  # Misclassification\n","                # Store the misclassified sample, prediction, and true label\n","                misclassified_samples.append({\n","                    'input': x_test[i].cpu().numpy(),  # Store the input (image/tensor)\n","                    'predicted': yhat[i].item(),       # Predicted label\n","                    'true': y_test[i].item()           # True label\n","                })\n","\n","            # Stop if we've collected 4 misclassified samples\n","            if len(misclassified_samples) >= 4:\n","                break\n","\n","        # Exit the outer loop if we have enough misclassified samples\n","        if len(misclassified_samples) >= 4:\n","            break\n","\n","# Display the misclassified samples\n","for idx, sample in enumerate(misclassified_samples):\n","    print(f\"Misclassified sample {idx+1}:\")\n","    print(f\"  Predicted: {sample['predicted']}, True: {sample['true']}\")\n","    # If you want to visualize the input (assuming it's an image), you can do so here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"715b8fe6-26bd-4bb9-b8da-1ca492528ee6","metadata":{},"source":["<a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/share-notebooks.html?utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDL0321ENSkillsNetwork951-2022-01-01&utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_term=10006555\"> CLICK HERE </a> Click here to see how to share your notebook.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"46f20a3f-7d1b-4aea-9e74-e373ec30e1bb","metadata":{},"source":["<h2>About the Authors:</h2> \n","\n","<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDL0321ENSkillsNetwork951-2022-01-01\">Joseph Santarcangelo</a> has a PhD in Electrical Engineering, his research focused on using machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision to determine how videos impact human cognition.
